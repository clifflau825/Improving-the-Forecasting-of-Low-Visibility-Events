# Improving-the-Forecasting-of-Low-Visibility-Events
This is a respository for my dissertation project as a master student in MSc Data Science and Analytics at the University of Leeds in co-operation with the UK Met Office. 

Nowadays, our weather or atmospheric conditions are forecasted primarily using state-of-art physical models called Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). However, some suggested that the forecasts for visibility are far worse than other atmospheric-oceanic variables. This project aims to perform post-processing on raw NWP visibility outputs using non-parametric methods to improve forecast reliability.
